# Abstract
This project implements two neural networks, **RNN and LSTM, for character-level language modeling using the Shakespeare dataset.** Both models will be trained and then used to generate samples of length 100. **By varying the parameter T in the softmax function, the effects of this parameter are analyzed.**
